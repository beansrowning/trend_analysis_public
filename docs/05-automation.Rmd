# Automation {#automation}

There are many ways to automate data infrastructures. Here, we use [github
actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), which seem like a natural choice
given that the whole infrastructure is hosted on
[github](https://github.com/whocov/trend_analysis_public). However, note that
alternatives could be considered especially for group owning a dedicated server
which they can administrate at will - this will likely be a more robust solution
for achieving automation. In particular, it would make troubleshooting much
easier, as github actions do not let the user directly interact with the server
running the jobs.

In this chapter, we provide a few insights into how github actions have been
implemented.




## Overview of the github actions

Github actions permit to run parts of data pipelines automatically, as
summarised in figure \@ref(fig:overview). The results of github action runs as
well as the corresponding files are available on github under the 'actions'
[tab](https://github.com/whocov/trend_analysis_public/actions). In particular,
this page shows the current status of the different actions: 

* running (yellow): the job is currently running
* passed (green): the last job ran successfully
* failed (red): the last job errored

In every case, logs are available. These are particularly useful for
troubleshooting issues.


Each github action is defined by a YAML file stored in the hidden folder
*.github/workflows/*, currently containing:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "markup"}

sort(list.files(here::here("../", ".github", "workflows")))

```

* *auto_update_[region].yml*: analysis updates for a given region
* *auto_update_all.yml*: same, but for all regions
* *auto_synthesis.yml*: collects existing results for all regions, generate ELR
  report and send information products by email to a list of recipients
* *refresh_readme.yml*: update the *README.md* file 


Sub-sections below provide more information on these actions.


### Regional updates

#### Outline

This set of actions (one per WHO region) are implemented in the
*auto_update_[region].yml* files. They automate the following workflow:

* download and prepare the current data
* run all analyses for the region under consideration
* commit and push to github the resulting information products (i.e. the
  *asmodee_outputs/* folder) - see details on the regional analyses in the report
  chapter \@ref(reports)

**note**: Neither the data nor the compiled report (usually stored in the
  *outputs/* folder) are commited or pushed to github.


#### Schedule

These actions run every day at 12:30, 14:30, and 18:30 GMT. It can also be
triggered manually from the github action page (see figure
\@(fig:action-trigger) below.


```{r echo = FALSE}

cap <- "Manual trigger of actions from the github action page."

```

```{r action-trigger, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap = cap, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/action_trigger.png', dpi = NA)
```



### Updates of all regions

#### Outline

This action is implemented in the *auto_update_all.yml* and automates the same
workflow as the regional updates, but for all regions.


#### Schedule

This action runs every day at 16:00 and 22:00 GMT. It can also be triggered
manually from the github action page (see figure \@ref(fig:action-trigger). As an
option, the user can specify a single WHO region (using the upper case
abbreviations) when manually triggering a run of this action.




### ELR synthesis

#### Outline

This action is implemented in the *auto_synthesis.yml* and automates the following
workflow:

* compile results of all regions using the latest analyses on github from the
  *asmodee_outputs/* folder
* generates an ELR report - see details on the ELR synthesis in the report
  chapter \@ref(reports)
* creates a zip archive of: 
    + the ELR report as a self-contained *html* file
    + an *xlsx* spreadsheet containing ELRs for all countries alongside key indicators
    + a text file listing countries excluded from the analysis as well as the
  rationale for their exclusion
* sends an email to a list of recipients hard-coded in the script
  *run_synthesis.R* (located in the root folder) with this zip attached

**note**: this job does not commit anything to github; the only end-result
  persisting after the job has run is the email and its attachments.


#### Schedule

This action runs every Monday at 6:00 GMT. It can also be triggered
manually from the github action page (see figure \@ref(fig:action-trigger).


#### Automated emails

Automated emails, as currently implemented, require SMTP authentication for the
free SMTP provider [*sendinblue*](https://www.sendinblue.com/). This is
currently done through Thibaut Jombart's account, linked to the gmail address
*thibautjombart@gmail.com*.  While emails will look like they were sent from
this email, they were actually sent by a different provider, which will often
result in these emails being marked as SPAM. Double-check your SPAM folder if
you are on the list of recipients and seem to have missed the email.



### README updates

#### Outline

This action is implemented in the *refresh_readme.yml* and ensures that the
*README.md* displaying results on the landing
[page](https://github.com/whocov/trend_analysis_public) of the github project is
updated every time new results are generated. The README is updated by
recompiling the file *README.Rmd*.


#### Schedule

This action runs every time there is a push to the main branch resulting in a
change of files, excluding: 

* *README.md*
* *run_synthesis.R*
* *report_sources/elr_review.Rmd*




## Using secrets

### Github secrets in a nutshell

The automation process may require inputs such as passwords and authentication
tokens which cannot be stored on a public github repository for obvious security
reasons. Github actions provide a workaround for such issues through github
[secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets). Secrets
are essentially small bits of data stored encrypted on github, which are tied to
a specific repository (figure \@ref(fig:secrets)). Once set up, a secret cannot
be viewed again, but it can be modified or deleted.

```{r echo = FALSE}

cap <- "Github secret page. This screenshot shows the location of github secrets on the infrastructure's page, underthe *Settings* tab. New secrets can be added there, and old secrets can be modified, but not visualised."

```

```{r secrets, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap = cap, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/secrets.png', dpi = NA)
```


### Using secrets in R workflows

The data stored in a secret can be used inside *github actions* by referring the
their value as `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` where `SECRET_NAME` is the name of
the secret. The approach to use this in an R workflow is then:

1. set the secret value (e.g. a password) as an environment variable
2. retrieve the value of the environment variable from R via `Sys.getenv()`
3. use the value in the R workflow, making sure that it is never output to the
   console, a file, or a persistent object, as these could then become public
   (e.g. in logs of actions)
   
At the time of writing, secrets are used for two purposes:

* to store the **phifunc_token** required to install the *phifunc* package; this
  enables github actions to use *phifunc* to download and process data
* to store the **SMTP password** used to send automated emails


Outside of R workflows, we also use another secret, a **Personal Authentication
Token** (**PAT**), to enable pushing to different branches of the github
repository. Figure \@ref(fig:secrets-use) shows how secrets can be used in the
configuration file of a github action.

```{r echo = FALSE}

cap <- "Sample of the *auto-synthesis* github action using github secrets. This screenshot was taken from the github action configation file *.github/workflows/auto_synthesis.yml*. Secrets are outlined in red. The first two (*PHIFUNC_TOKEN* and *SENDINBLUE_SMTP_PASSWORD*) are set up as environment variables, while the last one (*PAT_TIBO*) is passed directly as an input to the *checkout* action."

```

```{r secrets-use, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap = cap, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/secrets_use.png', dpi = NA)
```

Note that in the case of *phifunc_token*, we need to handle a non-trivial
situation as the token could be available in two different ways:

* **stored locally** in the root folder, in the case of a person's computer who was
  granted access and given the token file; this file is git-ignored and so
  should never end up on github
* available as an **environment variable**, in the case of github actions

This explains the circumvoluted code handling the installation of *phifunc* in
*scripts/remote_packages.R*: 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# Here we handle the phifunc install token as follows, by order of decreasing
# priority:

## 1. Grab the token from a local 'phifunc_token' file if it exists
## 2. Grab the token the environment variable 'PHIFUNC_TOKEN'
## 3. If the above is empty, set the value to NULL

phifunc_token_file <- here::here("phifunc_token")
if (file.exists(phifunc_token_file)) {
  phifunc_token <- scan(phifunc_token_file, what = "character")
} else {
  phifunc_token <- Sys.getenv("PHIFUNC_TOKEN")
  if (phifunc_token == "") phifunc_token <- NULL
}

# Install phifunc
if (!is.null(phifunc_token) & !require("phifunc")) {
  remotes::install_github(
    "whocov/phifunc",
    auth_token = phifunc_token,
    subdir = "phifunc", upgrade = "never")
}


```
